# Python_Challenge
The first portion of this Python Challenge is tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. 
The financial dataset called budget_data.csv is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
I have created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the averages of those changes. 
I have also analyzed the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease as well. 

The second portion of this Python Challenge is tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
The election data of this town is analyzed by the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes 
each candidate won. In addition the analyses also inclues the total number of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
