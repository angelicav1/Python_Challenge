# Python_Challenge
This Python Challenge is tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. 
The financial dataset called budget_data.csv is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
I have created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the averages of those changes. 
I have also analyzed the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease as well.
